Slate's/my current to-do list and thoughts/plans/intentions: 124g 5s 7c Guides interested in, multiple possible:

1. Azaka Stormfang for survival and reliability,
2. Musharib to get info on death cults,
3. Flask & Mist out of curiosity for how they can operate outside the system, and cheaper rates,

Activities:

1. Talk to the following Marchant leaders at Goldenthrone:,
2. Exene-Afa aboout magical weapons and gladiatorial fighting.,
3. Kwayoth√© about religious issues (maybe not me though she seems too fancy to like me).,
4. Wakanga about magic issues and because he is (Cindra?)'s friend (not me, I am not smart enough for wizards),
5. Jessamine: Maybe we can help her fulfil a contract, with permission to do so, for cash?,

Go to blacksmiths to find out how to get oil/treatment for my scale mail and its cost Possibly earn more money in a gladiator fight? Buy equipment, some personal some for group, with advice from guides. Eat out, to save money. Visit central docks and make contact with the Z? underground merchants who were bullying Priest Grandfather, see what their deal is. Maybe find Flask & Mist too? Do this evening time after spending/stashing money. My equipment preferences: Get some bonus for my arrows/longbow? Replace my dual-wield shortsword option with something else? (Depends on advice from gladiator Princess?) Get my scale mail protected. Lots of heat and insect protection Rations A tent A machete A waterskin Group stuff: A water collector A canoe Medical equipment? Magic? Questions for guides:

- How long do we need to be out there?,
- Are there resupply points along the way?,
- Can we supplement with food and materials from the forest etc?,
- What supplies are vital?,
- Will we need the Axebeak?,
- How do we have both Axebeak and canoe?,
- Plan to talk to Order of Gauntlet for info a good one? Is it Camp Vengeance we need for that?
